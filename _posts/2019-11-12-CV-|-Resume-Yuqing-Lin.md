## RESEARCH AND PROJECT	

[**Study on Framelets with Applications to Signal Processing**](https://linyq0591.github.io/2019/11/18/wavelet-poster-University-of-Alberta/) \| Research Intern

⌚ <  Jun 2019-Oct 2019  >
- Advisor: Prof. Bin Han (supervisor: Porf. I. Daubechies) | Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, **University of Alberta**
 
  - Applied quasi-tight framelet to signal and image denoising, which performs as well as tight framelets but is easier to generate
  - Implemented Image Inpainting using iteration of framelet threshold smoothing, which can restore an 80+% image from prior data less than 30% in general 
  - Designed a new method for image edge analysis using box spline quasi-tight wavelet framelet, which is able to detect Dirac edges and hidden edges better than shearlet, Canny, Chan-Vese methods and is also robust against noise

**Land and Air Amphibious Reconnaissance Vehicle** \| Team Leader, Key Developer

⌚ <  Dec 2017-Jun 2019  >
- Advisor: Prof. Yingjie Wu | College of Mathematics and Computer Science in Fuzhou University &Associate Professor Yanjun Zhang | Institute of Microelectronics Technology, BIT 

  - Constructed a land and air amphibious vehicle for reconnaissance and transportation, which won outstanding prize of "Challenge Cup"
  - Created a new vehicle structure— long arms, large propellers and stabilized platform, and continuous tracks
  - Achieved more than twice the duration by 6S battery and APM 2.8’s control to 2 modes, compared to similarly sized drones

**Robotic Interoperability Systems** \| Research Assistant 

⌚ <  Jun 2018-Jan 2019  >
- Advisor: Prof. Xiang Xie | Research Institute of Communication Technology, BIT
 
  - Completed multi-robot interoperability system by UWB localization and tested it for the World Robot Conference (2018) 
  - Produced multi-robot sound source following system, which is especially useful for helping fallen elders in hospitals.
  - Developed STM32 embedded applications and revised the upper monitor with Qt5 to specialize the system
  - Developed a 3-ball positioning coordination calculation algorithms using Python

**Intelligent Anti-lost Reminder for Cards** \| Team Leader, Key Developer

⌚<  Sep 2016-Sep 2017  >
- Advisor: Prof. Yingjie Wu | College of Mathematics and Computer Science in Fuzhou University & Instructor Xinghua Wang | Microsystems and Integrated Circuits club, BIT
 
  - Completed a device that prevented people from losing cards and applied it in dormitory bathrooms (reaching over 500 people
  - Designed 3 modules (sensor, process and reminder) using SystemView and soldered the 3-D circuit 
  - Earned first-author patent rights for the real product model (2018)
