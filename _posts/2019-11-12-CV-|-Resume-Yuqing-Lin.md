## RESEARCH AND PROJECT	

✦ **(Ongoing) Multipath effect in Line of Sight(LOS) and Non-Line of Sight(NLOS)** \| Ph.D. Research Student

< July 2022 - present >
Advisor: Academician Chibiao Ding & Professor Xiaolan Qiu | Institute of Electronics, UCAS

  - Model the LOS and NLOS scattering mechanism of typical scene to investigate the hidden information from images 
  - Utilize the priori model to detect ambiguity of 3D image reconstruction and obtain additional information from NLOS 
    
**Improved Reconstruction Algorithm on Restricted Solution Space** \| Ph.D. Student

< Jun 2021-Jun 2022 >
Advisor: Academician Chibiao Ding & Professor Xiaolan Qiu | Institute of Electronics, UCAS

  - Improved the 3D image reconstruction algorithm by restricting the solution space with priori knowledge from the object, which can generate more accurate results
  - Applied the algorithm to Monte Carlo simulation data, and the results’ gap to CRLB is 3 times less than traditional OMP method on average
    
**Research on Sparse 3D Imaging Method of Tomography SAR** \| Ph.D. Research Student         

<Jun 2020-Jun 2021>
Advisor: Professor Xiaolan Qiu & Instructor Zekun Jiao| Institute of Electronics, UCAS

  - Proposed a Tomography sparse 3D imaging algorithm based on OMP, and analyzed the effect of motion error and the difference from ground truth quantitatively.
  - Applied the algorithm to actual multi-antenna SAR system’s observation data and represented it in geographic coordinate system for scene analysis.


✦[**Study on Framelets with Applications to Signal Processing**](https://linyq0591.github.io/2019/11/18/wavelet-poster-University-of-Alberta/) \| Research Intern

 <  Jun 2019-Oct 2019  >
 Advisor: Prof. Bin Han (supervisor: Porf. I. Daubechies) \| Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, **University of Alberta**
 
  - Applied quasi-tight framelet to signal and image denoising, which performs as well as tight framelets but is easier to generate
  - Implemented Image Inpainting using iteration of framelet threshold smoothing, which can restore an 80+% image from prior data less than 30% in general 
  - Designed a new method for image edge analysis using box spline quasi-tight wavelet framelet, which is able to detect Dirac edges and hidden edges better than shearlet, Canny, Chan-Vese methods and is also robust against noise
