üéá**Wonderful time in University of Alberta in the summer of 2019:**

To extract the wanted information of the input, transformation of the signal is always necessary. I am deeply attracted by **wavelet transform**, which has so many attractive features. Thus, I applied for an internship **in the Mathematical and Statistical Sciences Department of University of Alberta** and became a research assistant of **professor Bin Han**, who had studied under the supervision of Prof. Daubechies. I explored the signal processing applying quasi-tight framelets from math perspective for the first time. 


‚úç **Exploration in Wavelet Transform:**

For example, well-performed quasi-tight framelets could be generated conveniently. Thus, I applied fast algorithm of them to **singularity detection and denoising**, which are important in IoT as well. 

Moreover, I designed a box spline quasi-tight framelet method to **detect Dirac edges and hidden edges**, which is robust to noise than many classical methods. 

I also implemented the 80+% **image restoration** from the prior data less than 30% in general by the iteration of framelet threshold smoothing. 

Along with learning basic math knowledge and advanced math methods, I gradually commanded of applying the wavelet from math to signal processing in engineering. Both the potential of signal processing is expanded by math and the meaningful applications of signal processing encouraged me to pursue something about it in the future.
