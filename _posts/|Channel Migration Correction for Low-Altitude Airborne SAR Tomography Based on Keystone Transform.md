## Abstract

SAR tomography (TomoSAR) has the three-dimensional (3-D) resolving ability. Most existing 3D imaging methods for TomoSAR consider the layovers for different channels are the same. However, in the low-altitude airborne cases, the deviation of layovers between channels becomes unneglectable. In this letter, we studied the channel migration phenomenon of sparse TomoSAR under low-altitude scenarios. We derived the model of the differential range from a particular target to different antennas, which is nearly a linear function along the array dimension. Therefore, we applied Keystone Transform on the array axis to correct this channel migration, and then the traditional sparse 3D imaging methods for TomoSAR can be applied to get the final 3D reconstruction results. The approach was tested with simulation data and also the real data of the MV3DSAR system, which is a mini drone-borne TomoSAR system. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide a more accurate solution to the low-altitude sparse TomoSAR reconstruction problem.
